First of all, thank you! Our community thrives because of people like you. 

## Types of Volunteers
There are a few ways to volunteer with this community: as a [Navigator](https://github.com/djangonaut-space/pilot-program/blob/main/navigators.md), [Captain](https://github.com/djangonaut-space/pilot-program/blob/main/captains.md), or Organizer. We have summarized those roles here as an overview but please read their detailed guidelines to get a more in-depth understanding of each. 

**Navigator:**
- Navigators can expect to commit 2-4 hours of their time each week over the 3 month session. 
- This would involve showing up to our virtual meetings/co-working hours and assisting other members or helping out members in the discord channel. 
- More details: [Navigator Guideline](https://github.com/djangonaut-space/pilot-program/blob/main/navigators.md)


**Captain:**
- Attend welcome and closing sessions and be available on discord.
- Check-in with Navigators and Djangonauts regularly throughout the program. 
- Commit 3-5 hours a week for 3 months. 
- More details: [Captain Guidelines](https://github.com/djangonaut-space/pilot-program/blob/main/captains.md)

**Organizer:**
- Responsible for organizing and leading meetings, update statuses on our website and GitHub, organization communication, Code of Conduct follow through, and recruiting volunteers.
