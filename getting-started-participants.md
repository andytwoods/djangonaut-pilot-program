# I want to participate, where do I start?

So you know what [we are about](https://github.com/djangonaut-space/pilot-program/blob/main/README.md), you have read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/djangonaut-space/pilot-program/blob/main/conduct.md), and you are interested in getting started, so what now? 

Because we are an inclusive community with a large range of skill levels we want to make sure we all have some understanding of a few points: Django, Python, Open Source Contributing, and Git. You aren't expected to be an expert in any of these but some knowledge will definitely help get you started. Please read the through the questions below to find a question that you can relate with to help you find your starting point. 


**What is Django/Python?**  
- If you haven't yet, you probably want to start with going over the [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) to get familiar with Django, Python, and Git. If you have some experience in one but not all of these, maybe skim through the parts you are familiar with. 

**What is Git/Github?**  
- If you are unfamiliar with Git and Github, [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) might be helpful.  

**What is Open Source Contributing?**   
- Github has created a great [Contributing Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) to go over what it's about, the process, and best practices. We'd encourage you to read it over. 

**What are the program expectations?**    
- You can read our [Navigator Guidelines](https://github.com/djangonaut-space/pilot-program/blob/main/navigators.md) to find more details about the responsibilities and expectations of our participants, or Navigators. 

**I want to join, how do I sign up?**
- Since we have scheduled session it will be difficult for members to join mid session so we encourage you to sign up before the beginning of the session. More information will be available soon.
